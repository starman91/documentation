#  Photovoltaic Field Array Time-Series (PVDAQ)

## Description

The Photovoltaic field array (PVDAQ) data is composed of time-series, raw performance data taken through a variety of sensors connected to a PV array. The data is typically taken at 15 minute averaged resolution, but can vary between systems. NREL source data is typically aggregated into the main database every 24 hours. Data is then processed to the NREL PVDAQ data lake on a monthly basis.

Some datasets have been acquired through previous research agreements with site owners, and with their permission, have now been made public. Those datasets are static and do not show any additional data increments. 

Our researchers utilize the data to monitor the durability of PV systems under a wide variety of conditions. Similar data within NREL archives also provides insites into experimental emerging technology systems. Addtionally, the data has proven useful in assisting in the development of data quality assurance software, and data analysis and machine learning tools.

### 2023 Solar Data Prize

The American-Made Solar Data Bounty Prize was open to U.S.-based PV system owners and entities authorized to share data from PV systems. These owners were invited to submit at least five years of historical time series data at a minimum of 15-minute time resolution for one or two of their systems. Datasets collected through this prize are meant to assist commercial and academic research and development efforts seeking to improve the accuracy of PV system modeling, and thus lower the risk associated with developing and operating those assets.

The Data Prize entries were submitted in one of two categories: systems < 5 MW DC capacity, and those >5 MW DC capacity. The data from the submissions are available to the public for download as part of the PVDAQ Data repository. The following are the system IDs of the winners, in numerical order, not placement by award.

#### < 5 MW DC system IDs:

* **2105** - A 237 kW multi building roof top deployment with highly variable mount orientations in Hawaii 
* **2107** - A 893 kW Fixed ground-mount facility in a highly active agricultural area in California
* **9068** - A 4.7 MW Single-axis tracked facility in Colorado

#### > 5 MW DC system IDs:

* **7333** - A 257 MW Single-axis tracker facility in California. This dataset is at a very high time resolution of 10s for all channels.
* **9069** - A 38.7 MW Fixed ground-mount facility in Georgia

#### Details on the Prize Datasets

These datasets differ from the regular PVDAQ repository storage architecture (See below) where data is broken down by year, month, and day. In each of the prize repositories the available metadata, any support files, and the entire dataset as was submittied and curated is available. Some of these the datasets are broken down by sensor channel set type, and in others the data is labeled by sensor channel tag names or bundles.

**Note:** *Some of the prize datasets are extremely large and can have 10s of GBs of data. These could take a long time to download so please plan accordingly*


## Data Dictionary

The PVDAQ data is partitioned by system_id, year, month and day. Raw data is reported at 15 minute increments in ISO 8601 date and time. The timestamp is striped and data is averaged daily. An example file output is included here.
